		\section{Typing Text}
		Since \LaTeX \ is a markup language, any text we type appears on the page,
		unless it contains one of the nine reserved characters of \LaTeX , listed below. 
		\texttt{\textbackslash \  \{\} \& \_ \^{} \% \~{} \#} \\
		If we want those characters to appear on the page, we must precede them by
		a backslash, or, in the special case of the backslash itself, we must use the
		command \texttt{\textbackslash verb}. In math mode, we can use the command \textbackslash backslash. 
		
			Note that there are three kinds of dash-objects. Hyphens are very short,
		and are typed the way you would expect, using ”-”. Dashes, as in the range
		1--2, are wider, and are typed using -{}-. If you feel a need for a wide—dash,
		you can use -{}-{}-.
		
		\section{Units}
		Lengths in \LaTeX \ can be given in a number of Units. \\
		\begin{tabular}{l l}
			cm & Centimeters \\
			em & The width of the letter M in the current font \\
			ex & The height of the letter x in the current font \\
			in & Inches \\
			pc & Picas (1pc = 12pt) \\
			pt & Points (1in = 72pt) \\
			mm & Millimeters \\
		\end{tabular}

	\section{Space}
	The most direct way to make spaces is simply to use the \texttt{\textbackslash hspace} and \\
	\texttt{\textbackslash vspace} commands, for horizontal and vertical space, respectively. Each \\
	takes one argument: a distance specification for the size of the space. The
	width or height of the space can be positive or negative. Note that \texttt{\textbackslash vspace} can only be used in vertical mode; that is, when you are starting a new para-
	graph or starting a float or doing something else that shifts text vertically.
	It will not work in a line.
	
	\LaTeX \ also has a number of predefined spaces. To produce a space with
	fixed width, and which cannot be used as a line break, you may use the \~{}
	character. This would typically be used to separate initials of an author,
	or in other situations where we don’t want to have a single letter or initial
	ending a line. More often, we don’t mind a line break, and want the space
	to shrink or grow according to the justification requirements on the line. In
	that case we make a standard space using \textbackslash \space ; backslash-space.
	
	There are wider stretchy spaces available to us: \texttt{\textbackslash quad} and \texttt{\textbackslash qquad}. There
	is also a "thin space": \texttt{\textbackslash ,.} The following words are separated by a thin space,
	a standard space, a quad, and a qquad, respectively.
	\begin{center}
		spacespace space \space space \space\space\space space
	\end{center}

	There are also predefined vertical spaces: \texttt{\textbackslash smallskip} \texttt{\textbackslash medskip}, and
	\texttt{\textbackslash bigskip}, that behave as their names imply.
	
	There are also some exceptionally stretchy spaces that we can use to \\
	push text around. For example, the following line is set using the command
	\texttt{text\textbackslash hfill} text. The line below it was set using \verb|text\ hfill text \hfill text|. \\
	text \hfill text \\ text \hfill text \hfill text \\
	You get the idea: \verb|\hfill| makes enough space to fill the line in question com-
	pletely. If more than one \verb|\hfill| appears on a line, then the two negotiate
	over how much space they each get.
	
	\section{Lines and Boxes}
	There are a variety of ways to make lines and boxes in L A TEX. The most
	basic is to make a horizontal rule using \verb|\hrule|.
	\hrule
%	\pagebreak
	\verb|\hrule| makes a new line, and fills it up with a horizontal line. If you
	don’t want an entire line, you can use \verb|\hrulefill|, as in \hrulefill .\\
	This command works like \verb|\hfill|, but instead of filling with space, it uses a \\
	horizontal rule to fill the line.\\
	To make a box around some content, you can use the \verb|\framebox| com-
	mand. The framebox command puts a box around its argument, so that
	\verb|\framebox{text}| looks like text . It takes optional width and position ar-
	guments, so that \verb|\framebox[3in][l]{text}| appears as\\
	\framebox[3in][l]{text}
	
	\section{Margins}
	This section is mistitled. \LaTeX \ does not really do margins, so much as it
	places text. It uses several variables in placing the text, which we can set.
	For example, to make the left margin on all even-numbered pages 0.5 inches
	wider than the default (which is 1 inch), we would define\\
	\verb|\evensidemargin=0.5in|.\\
	A list of the variables we can set and their default values follows.\\ \\
	\verb|\evensidemargin| \\
	\verb|\oddsidemargin| \\
	\verb|\topmargin| \\
	\verb|\textwidth| \\
	\verb|\textheight| \\
	\verb|\parskip| \\
	\verb|\baselineskip|
	
	\section{Tables}
	Sometimes we need to typeset tables. For example, consider Table 1. Any
	resemblance of the numbers in Table 1 to those from any authentic poll is
	purely coincidental.
	
	\section{Figures}
	We can also put figures into our latex documents. For example, the image in
	Figure 1 is found at \verb|http://www.math.wsu.edu/kcooper/M300/sniper.jpg,|
	\pagebreak
	\begin{table}
		\centering
		\caption{Results from a poll that probably never happened.}
		\begin{tabular}{||l|c||}
			\hline
			\multicolumn{2}{||l||}{\textit{What is your favourite animal?}}\\ \hline
			Animal & Percentage of respondents\\ \hline
			Dog & 43\% \\
			Cat & 44\% \\
			Schwarzenegger & 9\% \\
			We kill animals & 4\% \\\hline\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table} \\
	but must be converted to encapsulated postscript before it can be included in this document.
	
	\section{Homemade commands}
	It was the best of ideas. It was the worst of ideas. \LaTeX \ was conceived as
	a programming language. This is what makes it harder to process using a
	wysiwyg interface, but it also allows us to make our own shortcuts. If you
	know that a particular expression will appear repeatedly in your document,
	you can make an abbreviation for it, or even a command that allows you to
	specify arguments. In our case, the sequence “It was the best of \textit{fill in the
	blank}. It was the worst of \textit{fill in the blank}.” is to appear many times in this
	section, so we created a command as follows:\\ \\
	\verb|\newcommand{\dickens}[1]{It was the best of #1.|
	\\
	\verb|It was the worst of #1.}| \\ \\
	This command takes one argument, which appears wherever a \#1 appears
	in the text for the command. Thus, to typeset “It was the best of examples.
	It was the worst of examples.”, we need only to type \verb|\dickens{examples}|.
	
	\section{Citations and References}
	In technical documents there are many references to typographical objects
	from the document, and citations of materials from outside the document.
	TEX \cite{p1} and \LaTeX \ \cite{p2} lets us keep track of those citations by name, rather
	than number. Using the “thebibliography” environment gives us automatic
	\begin{figure}[t]
		\includegraphics[height=6cm, width=7cm]{spiner.jpg}
		\caption{Cats take vengeance on 4\% of respondents [3].}
	\end{figure}
	numbering of our references, while associating those numbers with names,
	so that we can refer to the references using the \verb|\cite| command. Likewise,
	for internal references, such as those to Figure 1, we can assign labels to
	a counter using the \verb|\label| command, and refer to them using the \verb|\ref|
	command.
